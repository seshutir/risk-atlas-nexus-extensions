Instructions:
1. You are given a premise and a hypothesis. Your task is to identify the relationship \
between them: does the premise entail, contradict, or remain neutral toward the hypothesis?
2. Your only output must be one of: (entailment | contradiction | neutral) without any \
lead-in, sign-off, new lines or any other formatting.
3. Do not provide any explanation or rationale to your output.
4. Use the following examples to learn how to do this, and provide your output for the last \
example given.

Premise: The weather forecast said it will rain tomorrow.
Hypothesis: It will be sunny tomorrow.
Output: contradiction

Premise: The company hired three new software engineers this month.
Hypothesis: The company did not hire any new employees.
Output: contradiction

Premise: Sarah bought a new book and has been reading it every night.
Hypothesis: Sarah enjoys reading her new book in the evenings.
Output: entailment

Premise: The museum is open from 9 AM to 5 PM on weekdays.
Hypothesis: The museum is open until 6 PM on Saturdays.
Output: neutral

Premise: The company announced a new product line featuring eco-friendly materials in their \
latest press release.
Hypothesis: The company is expanding its product offerings with a focus on sustainability.
Output: Entailment

Premise: The event was canceled due to the severe storm that hit the city.
Hypothesis: The event went on as planned, with no major disruptions.
Output: Contradiction

Premise: The CEO of the tech company gave a keynote speech at the conference yesterday.
Hypothesis: The keynote speech was well-received by the audience.
Output: Neutral

# v2
NLI_EXTRACTION_PROMPT2 = """{_PROMPT_BEGIN_PLACEHOLDER}

Instructions:
You are provided with a PREMISE and a HYPOTHESIS. \
Your task is to evaluate the relationship between the PREMISE and the HYPOTHESIS, following the steps outlined below:

1. Evaluate Relationship:
- If the PREMISE strongly implies or directly supports the HYPOTHESIS, explain the supporting evidence.
- If the PREMISE contradicts the HYPOTHESIS, identify and explain the conflicting evidence.
- If the PREMISE is insufficient to confirm or deny the HYPOTHESIS, explain why the evidence is inconclusive.
2. Provide the reasoning behind your evaluation of the relationship between PREMISE and HYPOTHESIS, justifying each decision.
3. Final Answer: Based on your reasoning, the HYPOTHESIS and the PREMISE, determine your final answer. \
Your final answer must be one of the following, wrapped in square brackets:
- [entailment] if the PREMISE strongly implies, directly supports or entails the HYPOTHESIS.
- [contradiction] if the PREMISE contradicts the HYPOTHESIS.
- [neutral] if the PREMISE and the HYPOTHESIS neither entail nor contradict each other.

Use the following examples to better understand your task.

Example 1:
PREMISE: Robert Haldane Smith, Baron Smith of Kelvin, KT, CH, FRSGS is a British businessman and former Governor of the British Broadcasting Corporation. Smith was knighted in 1999, appointed to the House of Lords as an independent crossbench peer in 2008, and appointed Knight of the Thistle in the 2014 New Year Honours.
HYPOTHESIS: Robert Smith holds the title of Baron Smith of Kelvin.
1. Evaluate Relationship:
The PREMISE states that Robert Haldane Smith, Baron Smith of Kelvin, KT, CH, FRSGS is a British businessman and former Governor of the British Broadcasting Corporation. It also mentions that Smith was appointed to the House of Lords as an independent crossbench peer in 2008. This information directly supports the HYPOTHESIS that Robert Smith holds the title of Baron Smith of Kelvin.
2: Reasoning:
The PREMISE explicitly mentions that Robert Smith is Baron Smith of Kelvin, which directly supports the HYPOTHESIS. The additional information about his knighthood, appointment to the House of Lords, and other titles further confirms his status as a peer, but it is not necessary to support the specific HYPOTHESIS about him holding the title of Baron Smith of Kelvin.
3. Final Answer: 
[entailment]

Example 2:
PREMISE: In 2022, Passover begins in Israel at sunset on Friday, 15 April, and ends at sunset on Friday, 22 April 2022.
HYPOTHESIS: Passover in 2022 begins at sundown on March 27.
1. Evaluate Relationship:
The PREMISE states that Passover in 2022 begins at sunset on Friday, 15 April, and ends at sunset on Friday, 22 April 2022. The HYPOTHESIS claims that Passover in 2022 begins at sundown on March 27. 
Upon analyzing the information, I found that the dates mentioned in the PREMISE and the HYPOTHESIS do not match. Since the dates provided in the PREMISE and the HYPOTHESIS are different, the HYPOTHESIS is contradicted by the PREMISE.
2. Reasoning:
The PREMISE provides specific information about the start date of Passover in 2022, which is April 15. The HYPOTHESIS, on the other hand, claims a different start date, March 27. This discrepancy indicates that the PREMISE and the HYPOTHESIS cannot both be true.
3. Final Answer:
[contradiction]

Example 3:
PREMISE: Little India in the East Village: Two restaurants ablaze with tiny colored lights stand at the top of a steep staircase.
HYPOTHESIS: The village had colorful decorations on every street corner.
1. Evaluate Relationship:
The PREMISE describes a specific scene in Little India in the East Village, where two restaurants are decorated with tiny colored lights at the top of a steep staircase. The HYPOTHESIS makes a broader claim that the village had colorful decorations on every street corner.
The PREMISE provides evidence of colorful decorations in one specific location, but it does not provide information about the decorations on every street corner in the village. The PREMISE is insufficient to confirm or deny the HYPOTHESIS, as it only describes a small part of the village.
2. Reasoning:
The PREMISE and HYPOTHESIS are related in that they both mention colorful decorations, but the scope of the HYPOTHESIS is much broader than the PREMISE. The PREMISE only provides a glimpse into one specific location, whereas the HYPOTHESIS makes a general claim about the entire village. Without more information, it is impossible to determine whether the village had colorful decorations on every street corner.
3. Final Answer:
[neutral]

You need to judge whether a claim is supported or contradicted by a Google search result, or whether there is no enough information to make the judgement. When doing the task, take into consideration whether the link of the search result is of a trustworthy source. Place your answer in square brackets.

Below are the definitions of the three categories:

Supported: A claim is supported by the search results if everything in the claim is supported and nothing is contradicted by the search results. There can be some search results that are not fully related to the claim.
Contradicted: A claim is contradicted by the search results if something in the claim is contradicted by some search results. There should be no search result that supports the same part.
Inconclusive: A claim is inconclusive based on the search results if:
- a part of a claim cannot be verified by the search results,
- a part of a claim is supported and contradicted by different pieces of evidence,
- the entity/person mentioned in the claim has no clear referent (e.g., "the approach", "Emily", "a book").
