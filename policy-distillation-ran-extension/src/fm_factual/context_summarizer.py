Your task is to summarize the CONTEXT with respect to the ATOM.

Instructions: 
Follow the steps below for CONTEXT summarization:
1. The ATOM can be true, false or not verifiable according to the SUMMARY.
2. It is very possible that no relevant information about the ATOM or related to the ATOM can be found in the CONTEXT. In this case, the SUMMARY must be: "None".
3. If the CONTEXT does not provide information about the ATOM, or if the CONTEXT does not mention anything related to the ATOM, the SUMMARY must be: "None".
4. If the CONTEXT provides information about the ATOM, the SUMMARY must contain the most relevant information of the CONTEXT and be such that we can fact-check the ATOM using this SUMMARY. 
5. The SUMMARY must not use reported speech to refer to the CONTEXT, for instance the SUMMARY must NOT state: "according to the context", "this context mentions", or "this article outlines", but instead the SUMMARY must only summarize the CONTEXT.
6. If the CONTEXT provides information about the ATOM, provide the SUMMARY and wrap the SUMMARY in a markdown code block.
7. If the CONTEXT does not provide information about the ATOM, the SUMMARY must only provide "None". Provide "None" and wrap it in a markdown code block. Do not mention that the context does not provide any information about the atom. Do not provide anything else.


Example 1:
CONTEXT:
+ Sense and Sensibility + Sense and Sensibility is a novel by Jane \
Austen , published in 1811 . + Jane Austen + Jane Austen ( 16 December 1775 - 18 July \
1817 ) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels , which interpret , \
critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century .

ATOM:
Sense and Sensibility was published in the summer of 1811.

SUMMARY:
```
Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811, however it is not known whether it \
has been published in summer.
```

Example 2:
CONTEXT:
+ Filmfare + Filmfare is an English-language , tabloid-sized magazine \
about Hindi-language cinema , popularly known as Bollywood . + Bollywood + Bollywood \
is the sobriquet for India 's Hindi language film industry , based in the city of Mumbai , \
Maharashtra .

ATOM: 
Filmfare is about cheese.

SUMMARY: 
```
Filmfare is about Hindi-language cinema, not about cheese.
```

Example 3:
CONTEXT:
+ 19th G7 summit + The Group of Seven ( G7 ) was an unofficial forum \
which brought together the heads of the richest industrialized countries : France , Germany \
, Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom , the United States , Canada ( since 1976 ) and the \
President of the European Commission ( starting officially in 1981 ) .

ATOM:
The 19th G7 summit only included Russia.

SUMMARY: 
```
The 19th G7 summit did not only include Russia, but also the heads of the six \
other richest industrialized countries and the President of the European Commission.
```

Example 4:
CONTEXT:
The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth," spans over 5.5 million square kilometers across nine countries. \
It is home to millions of species, many of which are yet to be discovered. The rainforest plays a crucial role in global oxygen production \
and carbon dioxide absorption. However, it faces severe threats from deforestation, illegal mining, and climate change. Conservation efforts \
are ongoing, with governments, environmental organizations, and indigenous communities working together to protect this vital ecosystem. 

ATOM:
Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of particles at the smallest scales, where classical physics no longer applies.

SUMMARY:
```
None
```

Example 5:
CONTEXT:
+ Artemis + She was the Hellenic goddess of the hunt , wild animals , \
wilderness , childbirth , virginity and protector of young girls , bringing and relieving \
disease in women ; she often was depicted as a huntress carrying a bow and arrows .

ATOM:

Many cities, including the local area, were caught off guard by the sudden popularity of scooters, and their original infrastructure was ill-prepared for this new trend. Early attempts to regulate the scooters were chaotic and ineffective, often leading to public frustration. Some cities took drastic steps, such as banning scooters altogether, while others focused on infrastructure improvements, like adding dedicated lanes for scooters and bicycles. The city council's recent approval of new regulations was part of a larger effort to stay ahead of the curve and provide a balanced approach to regulating modern transportation options while encouraging their growth.

Despite the noise of the traffic, the chatter of pedestrians, and the hum of city life, there was a strange sense of stillness around her. It was as if time had slowed down, giving her a moment to breathe, to collect her scattered thoughts. She glanced up at the towering buildings that seemed to stretch endlessly into the sky, their glass facades reflecting the fading light. Everything around her was in constant motion, yet she felt an unexpected calm. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, pulling her back to reality, and she sighed, reluctantly slipping it out.

After several rounds of talks, including visits to the tech company’s headquarters and multiple brainstorming sessions, a partnership was finally agreed upon.

While he understood the business side of things, he worried that the essence of the sport would be lost in the shuffle of corporate interests. Jonathan's concerns were not unique; many fans shared his belief that sports should remain a pure form of entertainment, untainted by outside influences. But as the announcement about the new partnership came over the loudspeaker, he tried to push aside his doubts. Maybe, just maybe, the team would find a way to balance innovation with tradition.",

The spreadsheets she once relied on seemed outdated, and she couldn't find a budgeting tool that worked for her lifestyle. It was then that a friend recommended the new app, which promised to simplify everything. Intrigued, Ellen downloaded it and began the process of linking her bank accounts. To her surprise, the app immediately pulled in her transaction history and categorized her expenses. She was impressed by the level of detail the app provided. It offered insights into her spending habits, helping her identify areas where she could cut back. The best part? The app also included tips on how to invest her savings, using algorithms to recommend strategies that aligned with her risk tolerance. Ellen felt empowered by the app’s comprehensive approach to personal finance and began using it religiously. She also recommended it to her friends and family, confident that it could help them take control of their financial futures as well.",
    #         "Brian had never been particularly interested in finances. As a freelance graphic designer, his income varied from month to month, making it difficult to plan his spending. He lived in a small apartment, often struggled to pay bills on time, and would occasionally splurge on a new piece of equipment for his studio without thinking about the long-term impact on his budget. While he had heard about the new finance app, he was skeptical. After all, he didn’t want a program telling him what to do with his money. However, after an unexpected tax bill arrived, Brian realized that he needed to take a more serious approach to managing his finances. He decided to give the app a try. At first, he found it annoying that the app tracked every single transaction, but soon he began to appreciate its guidance. The app helped him set realistic financial goals, and with its alerts and reminders, he managed to avoid late fees. While Brian still wasn’t thrilled by the idea of budgeting, he had to admit that the app had made his financial life significantly easier."
