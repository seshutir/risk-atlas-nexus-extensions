# Single turn version
QUERY_BUILDER_PROMPT_V1 = """{_PROMPT_BEGIN_PLACEHOLDER}
Instructions:
Your task is to generate a Google Search query about a given STATEMENT. \
Optionally, you are also given a list of previous queries and results called KNOWLEDGE. \
Your goal is to generate a high quality query that is most likely to retrieve the relevant information about the STATEMENT.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION CRITERIA: a well-crafted query should:
  - Retrieve information to verify the STATEMENT's factual accuracy.
  - Seek new information not present in the current KNOWLEDGE.
  - Balance specificity for targeted results with breadth to avoid missing critical information.

Process:
1. Construct a Useful Google Search Query: 
  - Craft a query based on the QUERY CONSTRUCTION CRITERIA.
  - Prioritize natural language queries that a typical user might enter.
  - Use special operators (quotation marks, "site:", Boolean operators, intitle:, etc.) selectively and only when they significantly enhance the query's effectiveness.

2. Provide Query Rationale (2-3 sentences): 
  Explain how this query builds upon previous efforts and/or why it's likely to uncover new, relevant information about the STATEMENT's accuracy.

3. Format Final Query: 
  Finally, present your query enclosed in square brackets, like [QUERY].

KNOWLEDGE:
{_KNOWLEDGE_PLACEHOLDER}

STATEMENT:
{_STATEMENT_PLACEHOLDER}

# Multi-turn version (experimental)
QUERY_BUILDER_PROMPT_V2 = """{_PROMPT_BEGIN_PLACEHOLDER}
Instructions:
You are engaged in a multi-round process to refine Google Search queries about a given STATEMENT. \
Each round builds upon KNOWLEDGE (a list of previous queries and results, starting empty in round 1). \
Your goal is to improve query quality and relevance over successive rounds.

QUERY CONSTRUCTION CRITERIA: a well-crafted query should:
  - Retrieve information to verify the STATEMENT's factual accuracy.
  - Seek new information not present in the current KNOWLEDGE.
  - Balance specificity for targeted results with breadth to avoid missing critical information.
  - In rounds 2+, leverage insights from earlier queries and outcomes.

Process:
1. Construct a Useful Google Search Query: 
  - Craft a query based on the QUERY CONSTRUCTION CRITERIA.
  - Prioritize natural language queries that a typical user might enter.
  - Use special operators (quotation marks, "site:", Boolean operators, intitle:, etc.) selectively and only when they significantly enhance the query's effectiveness.
