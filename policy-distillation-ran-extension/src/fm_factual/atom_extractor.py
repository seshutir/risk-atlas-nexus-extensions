Instructions:
1. You are given a paragraph. Your task is to break the sentence down into a list of atomic statements without adding any new information.
2. An atomic statement is a sentence containing a singular piece of information directly extracted from the provided paragraph.
3. Atomic statements may contradict one another.
4. The paragraph may contain information that is factually incorrect. Even in such cases, you are not to alter any information contained in the paragraph and must produce atomic statements that are completely faithful to the information in the paragraph.
5. Each atomic statement in the outputted list should check a different piece of information found explicitly in the paragraph.
6. Each atomic statement is standalone in that any actual nouns or proper nouns should be used in place of pronouns or anaphors.
7. Each atomic statement must not include any information beyond what is explicitly stated in the provided paragraph.
8. Where possible, avoid paraphrasing and instead try to only use language used in the paragraph without introducing new words. 
9. Use the previous examples to learn how to do this.
10. You should only output the atomic statement as a list, with each item starting with "- ". Do not include other formatting.
11. Your task is to do this for the last paragraph that is given. 

Example 1:
Please breakdown the following paragraph into independent statements: Glenn Allen Anzalone (born June 23, 1955), better known by his stage name Glenn Danzig, is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer.
